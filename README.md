#Background
V. Isualize has given a brand-new assignment. Using Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, I will create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, I will create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, a written report summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

##What You'll See
This new assignment consists of two technical analysis deliverables and a written report to present your results. 

Deliverable 1: A ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type
Deliverable 2: A multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type
Deliverable 3: A written report for the PyBer analysis (README.md)

**DELIVERABLE 3: A written report for the PyBer Analysis
#Analysis
The written analysis has the following:

#Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of the new analysis is:
Results: To analyze and discover trends and create a complete overview of the Ride-Sharing data by city type which includes charts from Matplotlib libraries such as Line, Bar, Scatter, Bubble, Pie, and box-and-whisker plots. Then we determine the mean, median and mode using Pandas, NumPy and SciPy statistics. Our Final Analysis will show distinct line graphs of total weekly fares for each city type. 

** 2. Results
There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. 
The Suburban fares started around $1,000, and the analysis was not profitable, fare dropped in March and in mid-April.
The Rural fares started at around $200, the analysis shows fares increase and dropped till the end of April.
The Urban fares start with an average of $1,800 with a consistent increase around 2,300.

There is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types. Based on our findings we can prepare business recommendations for addressing any disparities among the city types 

1)Our analysis indicates that there are many good opportunities to expand the business in rural and suburban city, including hiring drivers to operate and expose business in rural and suburban cities. This can be deduced by examining our charts and figures. Lets take a look:

2)Since the Urban cities fare is the most consistent and rated higher, this will give many business opportunities to expand rides

3) The Rural cities is the lowest of the two city types(Urban and Suburban). This is shown from the distance between fares and increase in business in other sectors on the line graph. Since there is room for growth, an expansion of fares would assist the company in gaining financially and benefitting their data.
